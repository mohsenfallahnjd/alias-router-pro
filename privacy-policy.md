# Privacy Policy — Alias Router Pro

Alias Router Pro does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

- Aliases and settings are stored locally using Chrome’s `chrome.storage.sync`.
- No personal information, browsing history, or sensitive data is collected or sent anywhere.
- Permissions (`storage`, `tabs`, `contextMenus`, `omnibox`) are used strictly to provide the extension’s single purpose:
  - save/manage aliases,
  - open URLs in current/new tab,
  - enable a right-click “Open as alias” menu,
  - support the omnibox keyword `go`.

Removing the extension or clearing Chrome’s extension storage deletes all saved aliases and settings.
